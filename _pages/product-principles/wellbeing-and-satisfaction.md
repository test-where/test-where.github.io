## The greatest waste

"The greatest waste <...> is failure to use the ability of people." - "Out of the Crisis" by W. Edwards Deming.

> What is needed to take advantage of the ability of people is to create systems that:
> 
> * Respect people
> * Provide joy in work (tell how their work contributes to providing customer value)
> * Allow those doing the work to improve the process for doing so (give people authority to make changes, along with the tools, training and support to make the right choices)
> * Provide support (training, coaching, job instructions etc.)
> * Put people in the position to succeed
> * Avoid creating pressures that run counter to doing this
> * Support intrinsic motivation
>

## Intrinsic motivation

> Unlike extrinsic motivation, fueled by external rewards like money, recognition, or grades, intrinsic motivation comes from within. It's the satisfaction and fulfillment people derive from the activity itself. When youâ€™re intrinsically motivated, you do something not because you have to but because you genuinely enjoy it, find it meaningful, or see it as a way to grow.
> 
> Types of intrinsic motivation:
>
> * Autonomy: The Drive for Self-Direction
> * Mastery (Competence): The Desire to Improve
> * Purpose (Meaning): Finding Meaning in the Work
> * Curiosity: The Joy of Exploration
> * Interest and Enjoyment: The Fun Factor
> * Challenge: The Thrill of Overcoming Obstacles
> * Social Connection (Relatedness): Building Meaningful Relationships
> * Creativity and Self-Expression: The Need to Create
