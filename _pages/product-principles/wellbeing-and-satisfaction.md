## The greatest waste

"The greatest waste <...> is failure to use the ability of people." - Out of the Crisis by W. Edwards Deming.

What is needed to take advantage of the ability of people is to create systems that:

* Respect people
* Provide joy in work (tell how their work contributes to providing customer value)
* Allow those doing the work to improve the process for doing so (give people authority to make changes, along with the tools, training and support to make the right choices)
* Provide support (training, coaching, job instructions etc.)
* Put people in the position to succeed
* Avoid creating pressures that run counter to doing this
* Support intrinsic motivation
