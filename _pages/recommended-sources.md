### Testing newsletters

- [Software Testing Weekly](https://softwaretestingweekly.com/). I like to say that this newsletter is like a good weekly mini-conference providing interesting food for thoughts regularly. I have found a lot of good articles and authors to follow just because of subscribing to this newsletter. [Dawid Dylowicz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawid-dylowicz/), keep up the good work!

Other (not-so-good, but) notable mentions:

- [Ministry of Testing Newsletter](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/newsletter). That would be my #2 option behind Software Testing Weekly as MoT provides different content, but in my opinion, the balance of social vs. technical topics is more to the social side.
- [Coding Jag](https://www.lambdatest.com/newsletter/) powered by LambdaTest. The content is very similar to Software Testing Weekly, yet promotes some of their own articles in the mix.

### Other quality blogs and podcasts

- [Jeff Nyman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffnyman/). Worth following on LinkedIn as he shares his own blog posts there and engages in comments sharing detailed and insightful thoughts.
    - [TesterStories.com](https://testerstories.com/). One of my favorite blogs that provides detailed articles with exact specifics and/or actionable advice, models, and rules of thumb.
- [Lina Zubytė](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linazubyte/)
    - [Quality Bits podcast](https://qualitybits.tech/podcast/). A well-balanced (between social and technical topics) podcast with interesting guests (the experts in their fields).

### Modern Testing & DevOps

- [Alan Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-l-a-n/).
    - [AB Testing podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/abtesting) (with Brent Jensen). One of the best podcasts about testing and quality ("which isn't all that modern, and not really about testing - except when it is"). If you are not a fan of not-so-small small talk, you may need to fast forward some of the beginnings, but the later parts are definitely worth it.
    - [Modern Testing principles](https://www.moderntesting.org/) (or a longer article - [Modern Testing Principles Explained](https://testastic.wordpress.com/2019/05/27/modern-testing-principles-explained/))

    - ["Deming's Journey to Profound Knowledge" (book)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122800609-deming-s-journey-to-profound-knowledge)
    - [William Edwards Deming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming). “Grandfather of quality”. Many modern testing and quality ideas can be traced back to Deming's principles from the 1950s-1990s.

        - [Assessing Agile Quality Practices with QPAM](https://leanpub.com/qualityassessmentpracticesmodelqpam). A nice book provides a model (derived from the Modern Testing [Quality Culture Transition Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kan20hYsdbvk7HW4si-X6Ve1fLtCeTI2H_PjiniKsxY/edit#gid=1897633328)) for quality assessments within agile teams.

    - [TestGuild News Show](https://testguild.com/podcasts/news/). A weekly wrap-up of interesting things happening around in the world of testing.

### Performance testing

- [RAIL model](https://web.dev/articles/rail). "A user-centric performance model that provides a structure for thinking about performance." A long time ago I started my journey into performance testing topic from analyzing the RAIL model (and I still think it is pretty valid today). However, Core Web Vitals were introduced later, and now it seems as the right way to go.
    - [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals). "A newer initiative by Google to provide unified guidance for quality signals that are essential to delivering a great user experience on the web. It is the recommended approach for defining performance goals over RAIL."
- [Scott Moore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottmooreconsulting/). Sometimes Scott posts controversial stuff (and that is still interesting), but a lot of times he shares interesting news and resources related to performance testing.

### Yearly reports, research

Other (not-so-good, but) notable mentions:

- [Capgemini World Quality Report](https://www.capgemini.com/us-en/insights/research-library/world-quality-report-2023-24/). Shallow. Some questions (and especially their respective options) indicate the creators do not understand that deeply the field of quality, testing, competence development, etc.
