### The Concept

The Testing Pyramid is a concept in software testing that visualizes and categorizes the different types of tests that should be used in a software testing strategy. It is represented as a pyramid to emphasize the distribution and quantity of each type of test.

I really like how [Martin Fowler summarizes Testing Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/#conclusion-test-pyramid) in ["Testing Strategies in a Microservice Architecture"](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/) (which do not only explains Testing Pyramid, but gives a solid advice for overall Test Automation strategy):

_"By following the guidelines of the test pyramid, we can avoid decreasing the value of the tests through large boated test suites that are expensive to maintain and execute."_

### The Dynamics

Such distribution is a healthy indicator of a mature project. However, sometimes project context (i.e. project start, huge refactors, etc.) may dictate other proportions - temporarily - until it reaches healthy and balanced state (again).

Testing Pyramid dynamics in project start is described nicely by [The Home of Web Automation](https://www.thehomeofwebautomation.com/) using ["The Testing Pavlova" model](https://www.thehomeofwebautomation.com/google-might-be-wrong/):

### The Fun

Testing Pyramid is a model and likewise other models it can be wrong, but useful. And similar to other models, Testing Pyramid can be used for guiding better conversations.

[Michael Kutz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/micha-kutz/) designed a [physical Testing Pyramid](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/micha-kutz_i-optimized-my-test-automation-pyramid-cutout-activity-7124683737476276226-FTiZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) - you can print and build it to have a great conversation starter.
