The following article is based on [a testing jobs salary survey in Lithuania](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/deimantas-liubertas_kiek-lietuvoje-u%C5%BEdirba-qa-2025-activity-7297203695379738625-CWHt/).

After I composed [a similar article in 2024](/_pages/testing-jobs-salaries-in-lithuania-2024.html)...

...[Deimantas Liubertas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deimantas-liubertas/) and [Kristina Pečiukonytė](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristina-pe%C4%8Diukonyt%C4%97-473b998/) invited me to join the efforts this year, so I gladly did! IMHO, survey improvements this year helped to build a better understanding, uncover new findings, and gain some more trust in collected data quality.

Also, Deimantas has provided a comprehensive [video overview of the results](#TODO) including comparisons of averages between roles, geographies/cities, year-to-year trends, qualitative feedback, and more. All in all, it is a great initiative!

Traditionally, I am serving a scatter plot and some of analysis and insights below.

**Juniors**. The trend line is going from ~2000 to ~2400 Eur/month from 1 to 3 years of experience.

Distributions by experience:
* 1 year (incl. < 1 year) - 38 data points - 1200-3100 Eur/month. (Good to see that even though the times are difficult, there are still many new specialists entering the QA market in Lithuania.)
* 2 years - 8 data points - 1500-3000 Eur/month
* 3 years - 4 data points - most around 2000-2200 Eur, and one - 3200 Eur.

From my personal experience, we tend to question Juniors when they arrive at 2 years of experience whether they are ready for promotion to Mid role already, and if not yet, why. As always, it depends on the context/environment, but 2 years feels like the right time to raise that question (if it has not been raised already). Therefore, Junior "data points" at 3 years of experience raise questions.

**Mids**. The most Mid data points are between 1-6 years of experience, even though there are Mid data points all across the 1-10 years interval. The polynomial trend line arrives from ~2400 Eur/month on 1 year to nearly ~4000 Eur/month at 6-7 years of experience, and continues to go up to ~4500 Eur/month at 10 years.

Last year we saw trend line saturation ("market standard") at about ~4000 Eur/month mark. Situation would be the same if not the single data point at ~6600 Eur/month at 10 years. Other than that there are only a few Mids with 6+ years of experience and well above that 4000 Eur/month mark.

"Soon-to-be-seniors". Similarly to last year, we see a group at 3-6 years of experience going above that 4000 Eur/month mark. The rule is still valid - proper upskilling beats years in "comfort zone".

**Seniors**. Senior interval starts at 3 years of experience showing that promotions to Senior positions happen no earlier than around 3-4 years of experience. However, there are more Seniors with 3 years of experience this year (6 in 2025 vs 1 in 2024) - and that could be a good sign that young individuals entering QA market are more and more capable. Out of those 6: 2 - "job hoppers" with 3rd job in 3 years, and 4 "loyals" - growing into seniors in their first workplace.

The trend line starts at ~4000 Eur/month and slowly goes to ~5500 Eur/month as careers progress. However, data points are really scattered both ways and that may reflect the fact that Senior QA skills, quality, value, and expectations differ a lot between different companies.

Comparing to the last year, there are much more points above 6000 Eur/month that before. Importantly, that shows that stepping into Lead/Manager roles is not necessary to get higher compensations.

On the other hand, there is a group (~10) of Seniors with 8+ years below 4000 Eur/month mark.

**Lead** (Principal, Staff roles, "middle management"). Interval starts at 3 years of experience (vs a single data point with 4 years of experience last year) showing that promotions to Lead roles happen no earlier than around 3-4 years of experience. (Isn't that too early?)

The trend line starts at ~4000 Eur/month and rises towards ~6000 Eur/month at 10+ years of experience. Colleting wider range of years of experience this year shows that Lead role salary hits "market standard" of ~6000 Eur/month and most of Leads with 10+ years of experience stay around that mark. Only a few Leads get close to or above 7000 Eur/month.

**Manager** (Directive, Head of QA/Testing roles, Lead of Leads). Interval starts at 6 years of experience (with a single data point with 6 years of experience, and others starting at 7 and 9 years of experience) showing that promotions to Manager/Director roles typically happen no earlier than around 8-9 years of experience. The trend line does not make much sense as data points are highly scattered saying "it depends".

However, if you really want to get some insight - one can see a gap separating two groups of Managers/Directors - one group is around 5000-6000 Eur/month band, and the other at 8000-10000 Eur/month (yeah, and that one point at 13500 Eur/month).
