Or, **Product Pyramid**:

## Product

[**Focus**](/product-principles/focus/)

- Product strategy (mission, vision, objectives, success metrics, North Star, etc.) is well-known to the whole team

- The team is picking improvement ideas carefully and saying "NO" to a lot of things

[**Powered by Insights**](/product-principles/powered-by-insights/)

- Most decisions are based on data/insights

- A variety of data sources are considered - analytics, customer data, new tech insights, industry trends, engineering team findings, etc.

[**Transparency**](/product-principles/transparency/)

- Product strategy is communicated clearly and with respective reasoning data

- There is no feeling of a "hidden agenda"

[**“Placing Bets”**](/product-principles/placing-bets/)

- Everyone, especially product leaders, accepts some solutions would not solve the problem and that is the cost of experimenting to find the best solutions that do

- Product leaders and stakeholders do not hesitate to remove features that do not bring value

## Code & System

[**Code Quality and Tech Debt**](/product-principles/code-quality-and-tech-debt/)

- Unit testing, code maintenance, tech debt tracking, continuous improvement

- Standards (code conventions, architecture, diagrams, documentation, etc.)

- Frameworks, tools, third-party libraries, and other dependencies are up-to-date

[**Automation and Tools**](/product-principles/automation-and-tools/)

- The team has proper automation and tools that allow it to move fast (high productivity) and not to break things (high quality)

- Automation is seen as a necessity rather than a roadblock/obstacle in a process

- Automating both functional tests and quality attribute (a.k.a. non-functional) tests

[**Deployment Infrastructure**](/product-principles/deployment-infrastructure/)

- The team is engaged in CI/CD and actively uses, adjusts (when needed), and maintains their CI/CD pipelines

- The majority (or all) of test automation is part of deployment infrastructure (not separate build jobs)

- Branching and versioning strategy

- Release strategy allows small, frequent, uncoupled releases

- Disaster recovery, restore mechanisms, quick reaction to production incidents

[**Monitoring and Observability**](/product-principles/monitoring-and-observability/)

- The team can answer most operation-related questions (business outcomes related and technical) via observability

- Metrics, signals, and KPIs are balanced and distributed across Product (North Star, business success metrics), System (SLAs), Code, and Processes

- Business value discussions focus on Product and System KPIs, and Code and Process KPIs are used mostly for diagnostic/debugging purposes

## Teamwork & Process

[**Outcomes over Output (Results over Effort)**](/product-principles/outcomes-over-output/)

- Understanding of value and quality is based on product strategy and business outcomes, not delivered volume of code/features (or story points)

- Progress is measured by outcomes, not effort (as effort without progress is useless)

[**Flow**](/product-principles/flow/)

- Delivering fast and making work visible

- Limiting work-in-progress (WIP)

- Reducing batch sizes

- Reducing hand-offs between teams

- Identifying and removing constraints and waste

[**Sense of Ownership**](/product-principles/sense-of-ownership/)

- Team efforts translate to meaningful outcomes, so the team owns those outcomes and cares to deliver results

- The whole team cares for quality

[**Empowered with Problems to Solve**](/product-principles/empowered-with-problems-to-solve/)

- Incoming requests (tasks) are based on problems to solve, not solutions to implement

- Business stakeholders and product leaders understand they do not know what is possible in engineering

[**Responsible Testing / Testing Breadth**](/product-principles/responsible-testing/)

- The testing strategy is well-known to the whole team and aligns with the broader quality strategy and product strategy

- Versatile testing techniques are applied, testing happens in a variety of places (see Holistic Testing) and covers a variety of quality attributes (a.k.a. non-functional requirements) - security, performance, accessibility, usability, etc.

- There are mechanisms to test/validate small increments frequently in production and/or with business (UAT, A/B testing, (key) user testing, etc.)

- Prevention over detection. Detected findings drive continuous prevention improvements.

- The testing approach is responsible - existing value is protected while experimenting and moving fast

[**Collaboration**](/product-principles/collaboration/)

- Not a democracy - decisions are owned by subject experts (only they know what is possible)

- However, experts are not made bottlenecks

- Most feedback loops (within the team, with stakeholders, with leadership) are short and fast

- The whole team cares for quality

[**Rapid Validation and Experimentation (“Fail-Fast”)**](/product-principles/rapid-validation-and-experimentation/)

- Ideas, prototypes, and solutions are tested early and quickly (both in Product Discovery and Product Delivery)

- Then, minimizing waste - eliminating what's not working before over-investing

## Culture

[**Trust over Control**](/product-principles/trust-over-control/)

- Leaders are leading with context, not command-and-control

- There is a safe and constructive environment to speak up, voice ideas, provide feedback, and suggest improvements

[**Principles over Process**](/product-principles/principles-over-process/)

- The team knows their core principles (values) well and shapes processes around them

- The team has high flexibility to change most of the processes and drives continuous process improvement

[**Innovation over Predictability**](/product-principles/innovation-over-predictability/)

- Product Mindset over Project Mindset

- Business Outcomes over Delivering Features

- Long-term investment/strategy over the time-boxed project budget

- Time to money/value/outcomes over (feature) time to market

[**Learning over (Fear of) Failure**](/product-principles/learning-over-failure/)

- The team emphasizes the value of learning (frequent and varied retrospectives, root cause analysis of customer issues, reading and listening to books, webinars, attending conferences and training)

- Continuous improvement over blaming and finger-pointing. Even though some experiments/features will result in poor outcomes (a.k.a. failures), the team is encouraged to experiment and innovate.

[**Well-being and Satisfaction**](/product-principles/wellbeing-and-satisfaction/)

- The team is feeling well, satisfied, and motivated
