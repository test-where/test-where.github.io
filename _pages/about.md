### About the author

"My name is [Justas Lau≈æadis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justas-lauzadis/). I have worked in software testing since the summer of 2015, but when I think of testing as an activity involving critical thinking, analysis, comprehension, problem-solving, balancing solutioning and experimentation - I got passionate about such things a lot earlier (back in high school, science olympiads, math, physics, chemistry, computer science, etc.) and got into exploring them since. I hope this blog will become yet another tool for exploring and experimenting further."

### About "TestWhere"

"TestWhere" as a word means nothing. Once I [decided to start a blog](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justas-lauzadis_writting-testing-blogging-activity-7123574749678493696-S6QT), I had a vision in my mind, and I recalled my previous experiences with some blogging platforms, revisited some of my previous sites, tested something, and chose one of the platforms. I needed to create a new site, and creating the name was one of the first steps. It took 15, maybe 20 minutes... I wanted something short and catchy. And I liked how these two words sound together. Reminded me of something...

### About the logo

![Logo](/logo.jpg){:width="200px"}

- Logo was created using DALL-E 3 image creator.

- The unicorn represents a "modern school" - speed, power, fancy new technology, moving fast and breaking things...

- That gentleman riding a unicorn (this is how DALL-E 3 imagines Isaac Newton) represents a "traditional school" - critical thinking, analysis, experimenting, questioning...

- Those figures are not opponents, but rather partners moving towards the same direction, the same goal.

- Originally, I wanted to add a prism and a rainbow (dispersion) as I found that would be a nice connection between Isaac Newton and unicorns, but when I recognized Newton's arms in this logo... it selected me.

- Finally, it reminds me [the coat of arms of Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Lithuania), and that is a cherry on top.
