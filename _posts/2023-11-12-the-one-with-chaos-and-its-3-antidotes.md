title: "The one with Chaos and its 3 Antidotes"

- This week I participated in Product Mindset training - and I was happy to hear that Product Managers (who were leading the training) are actively exploring how to apply experimentation principles in their client engagements. One of the most important idea - treat future improvements (epics, features, user stories, etc.) as hypotheses, and design experiments to test their actual impact. You can find more pointers towards such ideas here - [Effort, Impact and Experimentation in Testing](/effort-impact-and-experimentation-in-testing/).

- However, ideas and implementation are two different things. Some time ago I witnessed an attempt to implement OKRs framework in the organization. It ended as a chaos and failure due to the tool and context mismatch. In my subjective opinion, recent article about [OKRs in Software Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/okrs-software-engineering-abi-noda-enqdc/) (from [Abi Noda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abinoda/)) summarizes challenges (as well as successful team characteristics) pretty well. As you may guess, not only tooling (framework), but providing clarity ("leading by example"), stability/consistency and support (resolving data issues, providing data capabilities) are very important. Clarity, consistency and support - here it is.

- Talking about clarity - there is not a lot to recommend from this year's [TestCon Europe](https://testcon.lt/) conference, but [Lina Zubytė](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linazubyte/) and her talk ["How Minimalism Helps Build High-Quality Products"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlmLNz6N1uQ&list=PLqYhGsQ9iSEqxGQg10eEaivdO3F3vsgqc) is totally worth watching (and re-watching).

- Talking about consistency - another talk from TestCon to recommend is ["Better, Faster, Stronger - Delivering High-Quality Products"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdhFRVtHnPY) (from [Finn Lorbeer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorbeer/)). Even before this year's conference I remembered Finn from several years ago, when I was impressed by his talk about CI/CD principles, "forward-only" mindset, feature toggles, and so on. Back then, it sounded ambitious, brave and inspiring. And this year it sounded similarly inspiring, yet... interestingly familiar. So, later on I found that talk from "several years ago" - ["Better, Faster, Stronger - Delivering High Quality Products"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh-972LL0rU). 4 years apart the message have not changed much. But should it? Why, if it is still relevant? In my opinion, both those talks are still great today.

- Talking about support - Finn's consistency reminded me one of [Leadership paradoxes](/leadership-paradoxes/) - Paradox of Change, and its resolution - _"Success <...> comes from persistently staying with only a few messages and tasks, no matter how boring that may be for the leader personally."_ In my eyes, understanding and revisiting those leadership paradoxes may help fighting the imposter syndrome and the question "am I (doing) enough?" - as those two are no strangers in leadership roles as well.

- I like to say that "the opposite of a chaos is an organization." Therefore, 3 antidotes of chaos - clarity, consistency and support - are essential leading towards more (or better) organization and leaving the chaos behind.
