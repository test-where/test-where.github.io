- This week I had a chance to attend [TestCon Europe](https://testcon.lt/) conference. Some talks were great, while some others - not so great to say the least - and I promise more in-depth review some time later (as recordings have not yet arrived, and I want to watch at least some of them). However, similarly to DORA report, a lot of talks put a huge emphasis on user-centricity and focusing on business problem as there is a disconnect between business and software engineering a lot of times. On top of that, [Alan Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-l-a-n/), the author behind Modern Testing principles, put some nice thoughts around the issue saying it's ["Nothing New"](https://angryweasel.substack.com/p/nothing-new-711).

- [Michael Kutz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/micha-kutz/) designed and shared a real - I mean - [physical Testing Pyramid](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/micha-kutz_i-optimized-my-test-automation-pyramid-cutout-activity-7124683737476276226-FTiZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). If you have ever seen my working desk, you can easily see I like such "toys". For example, Rubik's cube that I have there is a great conversation starter as there is a story behind it of how I used it as an interview problem (and no, I have not asked to solve it during interview, that would be odd). Similarly, I see Michael Kutz's Testing Pyramid could be a great conversation starter - a toy and a model that could be kindly given away as a gift (or reminder) after the conversation about test automation strategy.

- Talking about pyramids, that real Testing Pyramid inspired me to compose a separate page with my favorite resources around the topic. Here it is - [Testing Pyramid](/testing-pyramid/).

- Something to try-out - remember DALL-E image composer engine? This August DALL-E 3 was released, and this October it reached wider audience via [Bing Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/create), so you can try it yourself there.

- Finally, it would be nice to end such weekly posts with some personal non-testing-related touch, don't you think? For this time, all the buzz around Ed Sheeran coming to Kaunas next summer reminded me [Oliver Anthony and his "Rich Men North Of Richmond"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqSA-SY5Hro) which I accidentally found in social media and it somehow resonated with me instantly. And it is no one-hit-wonder - other his tracks has something as well.
